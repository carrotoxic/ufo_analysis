   # Pseudocode: Initialize a variable x with value 10
   # Translation: We are creating a variable named 'x' and assigning it the value 10.
   # Explanation: This line of code is creating a storage location (variable) in the computer's memory. The variable is named 'x' and we are storing the number 10 in it.
   x = 10

   # Pseudocode: If x is greater than 5, print "x is greater than 5"
   # Translation: We are checking if the value stored in 'x' is greater than 5. If it is, we print the message "x is greater than 5".
   # Explanation: This is a conditional statement. The code checks if the condition (x > 5) is true. If it is true, it executes the code within the if block, which in this case is printing a message.
   if x > 5:
       print("x is greater than 5")
